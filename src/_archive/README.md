# _archive

This folder stores old/duplicate modules kept for reference.

- Archived on: 2025-09-02 (IST)
- Reason: Consolidating duplicates to reduce confusion and import mistakes.
- Rule: Nothing in `_archive/` is imported by the app. If something here is still needed, move it back to `src/` and fix imports.

Contents:
- `features-v2/` â€“ older duplicate of `src/features/*` (moved intact).
