## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- Always prefer **canonical docs** inside `advanced-engine-v2/`.  
- Use `_archive/` files only to check history or compare with older drafts.  
- If adding new docs, please follow the same structure:
  - Put maintained docs in a clear subfolder.
  - Move old/drafts to `_archive/` instead of deleting.
